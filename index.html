                        <h1>Feasibility Analysis</h1>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Barbados, the island of sun, sea and sand, the island where everyone comes to vacation, has so much to offer. Not only does this beautiful island offer luscious beaches, luxurious hotels, and wonderful tourist attractions, but our magnificent culture, and most importantly our amazing food, are unique. One of the most exciting things when vacationing on an island is the full experience of their food culture. Food is a universal language that communicates passion, good vibes and multiple tastes.  It is no different in Barbados! However, there is one problem: many food places that exist on our island are in computer terms, “Error 404 Not Found”. That's where we here at Down De' Gap comes in. We are here to cater to small food businesses island wide who are difficult to find, and not only point you to them, but also bring them to you! Moreover, this service will not only cater to tourists, but locals as well.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Product and Service Feasibility</h2>
                        <p>Desire and demand for this service - there are four basic things that we as humans need to survive: air, water, shelter and food. Food is essential to all living things, especially human beings. It is the human urge to try and experience different foods all the time and with the amount of food businesses in Barbados, that can be made possible. But there are a few issues that hinder this:
                        </p>
                        <u1 style="font-size: 20px">
                            <li>A lot of small food businesses are difficult to find.</li>
                            <li>Their locations are through areas that are hard to get to.</li>
                            <li>They do not deliver.</li>
                            <li>People do not want to go out of the comfort of their homes to get something to eat.</li>
                            <li>They get overpowered by large food companies.</li>
                            <li>Workplace demands make it difficult for people to prepare home cooked meals</li>
                        </u1>
                        <p>Solution:  Down De' Gap solves all these issues mentioned above. We are a service that is dedicated to putting small food businesses on the map! Down De' Gap intends to have a fully functional website that caters to all the issues mentioned. Down De' Gap plans to have all small food businesses on our website for the world to see and experience at their own pleasure. Not only will they be able to see the businesses and the products that they offer, but they will also be able to order their food through our website. That's not all, in addition to this, without leaving the comfort of their homes they will receive their food from us with our delivery service.</p>
                        <h2>Industry and Target Market</h2>
                        <p>Although the food delivery service in Barbados may seem to be very popular, it is to be noted that deliveries are primarily done for large food companies, some of whom have their own delivery services available. Companies such as Hopscotch, a competitor in our industry, although they might do deliveries, they are only partnered with large food companies such as Subway, Burger King, Chutney's etc. This in turn leaves the small food businesses in the industry at the bottom of the food chain. Furthermore, Hopscotch's association with primarily fast-food restaurants, means tourists who may want to experience the local cuisine is not their target demographics. This is where we here at Down De' Gap exploit this gap in the marketplace where we focus on small food businesses and advertising them for not only the tourists who visit our island but the locals as well. With our easy-to-use website, we plan to target everyone who just wants to get something to eat. From school children who want to working adults.</p>

                        <h1>Business Model</h1>
                        <p>For our business, we are working to create a website that will be focused on food delivery. Because many services like this already exist, our business falls under the standard business model as it is not changing the way that the online ordering market operates. Amazon is a well-known company that also falls under the standard business model, more specifically the Traditional Retailer Business Model. The company created its business by simply taking the already existing shopping and delivery services and moved it online. The company sells the goods of other businesses, as well as delivers the products to the buyer's home. Similarly, our company will be an online webpage where buyers are able to browse a selection of food menus, place an order and then have it delivered to their location.</p>

                </div>
                <div id="industryComp">
                    <div id="industryComp-left">
                        <h1>Industry and Competition Analysis</h1>
                        <p>This is an underdeveloped industry in Barbados and there is not much attention given to smaller food operators even though there is more demand for healthier, home-cooked and cheaper food options. We have the potential to do better than much in the industry since we have found a gap within the market that will be hard for anyone else to fill without great effort. </p>
                        <p>In terms of local delivery, Hopscotch largely focuses on larger firms and has long delivery times of more than an hour, even for close-by locations. They also have relatively expensive delivery fees that can sometimes cost more than the actual food itself. For such businesses, it would be difficult to network and reach out to a significant number of operators needed to gain entry into this sector; given that we will have a head start, it will be difficult to be overtaken. </p>
                        <p>Other local businesses in this field like Chirp Barbados and Doordash Delivery Express don't have professional web presences and thus make it difficult to figure out which businesses are covered under their program and how much that delivery costs, without interacting with them directly. They also do not post frequently and don't look like they are in operation or are a company with much activity. Another delivery service, C6, despite having the logistics for home delivery, does not deliver meals and mainly focuses on commercial goods and groceries, and is thus an indirect competitor but unlikely to be a future competitor.</p>
                        <p>Our multinational competitors like Doordash and Grubhub currently do not operate in Barbados or even much of the Caribbean. Therefore, they may be unlikely to open operations here, but even if they do, we will likely already have a place in the market that would be untouched by them as they would be unlikely to focus on the same businesses we focus on and may likely be more of direct competitors to Hopscotch.</p>
                        <p>Our business model also avoids the possibility of our business being held hostage by the operators we service by giving them full control of their pricing but still charging our own delivery fee. Therefore, there would be no incentive for the operators to challenge us since we will be largely responsible for their nationwide presence, their inability to manage deliveries themselves and given the lack of readily available substitutes, they may likely lose out on business if they decide to bargain against us.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, we can avoid much of the possible competition that exists at the current moment as there is very little room or incentive for new entrants to the market, there is already a lack of substitutes given this niche and thus a lack of rivalry, and the low incentive for our operators to bargain against us at the risk of losing business.</p>
